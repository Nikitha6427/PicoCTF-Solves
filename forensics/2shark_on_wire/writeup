so since there are no hints i used the prev challenge as a follow and used it to analyse and follow udp ports i noticed a few fake flags and a lot of aaaaaaaaaaa's between start and end all these aaaaaaaaa's had 22 has port number. so i applied the filter udp.port==22. then there wasnt much to see that chaned except for info which all statred with 5 but chnaged 3 digits so i copied the three digits and put them in ascii to convert and found the flag picoCTF{p1LLf3r3d_data_v1a_st3g0}
