this is literaaly one reverse challenge wher i actually understood what i did so we have a code. in order for the flag to display we should actually make the main function go to the win function. for that we use gdb and use disass win and main and subtract the address and get some value like 0x96 and then we run the instance using netcat and subtract our 96 with the address they gave. enter it and recieve the flag
